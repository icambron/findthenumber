A man comes up with two numbers and gives one person the sum of these numbers and another person the product of these numbers. He informs them that the sum of these two numbers is under 99. The person with the product goes to the person with the sum and says "I don't know the two numbers". The person with the sum replies with "I know that you don't know the two numbers".  Immediately, the man with the product says "now I know the two numbers" and then the man with the sum says, "now I know the two numbers too". What are the two numbers?
