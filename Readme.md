A man comes up with two numbers between 1 and 99 (meaning not 1 or 99) and gives one person the sum of these numbers and another person the product of these numbers. The person with the product comes up to the person with the sum and says "I don't know the two numbers". The person with the sum replies with "I know that you don't know the two numbers".  Immediately, the man with the product says "now I know the two numbers" and the man with the sum says, "now I know the two numbers too". What are the two numbers?
